# Optimizing-Aluminium-Procurement-through-Price-Forecasting

# Project Overview

The **"Optimizing Aluminium Procurement through Price Forecasting"** project focuses on leveraging time series forecasting techniques to predict aluminium prices. Accurate price forecasting aids in optimizing procurement strategies, reducing costs, and improving supply chain efficiency.

• **Business Problem:** The company faces challenges in efficiently procuring aluminium, a critical raw material for the steel and manufacturing industries. Currently, procurement is carried out on an ad-hoc basis without considering price fluctuations. This reactive approach often leads to higher procurement costs, directly affecting the company’s operational efficiency and profitability. Implementing a more strategic and data-driven approach to aluminium procurement can help mitigate these challenges and optimize costs.

• **Business Objective:** Minimize Procurement Costs

• **Business Constraints:** Minimize Risks from Market Volatility

• **Business Success Criteria:** Reduce procurement costs by at least 25%.

• **Economics Success Criteria:** Increase the overall revenue of the company by atleast 20%.

# Objectives

• To forecast future aluminium prices using advanced time series models.

• To analyze historical price trends and identify seasonal patterns.

• To optimize procurement decisions by reducing uncertainty in price fluctuations.

• To evaluate and compare the performance of different forecasting models.

# Methodology

# 1. Data Collection

• Collected historical aluminium price data from reliable sources.

• Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Visualized price trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns.

• Analyzed statistical properties such as mean, variance, and skewness.

# 3. Model Selection & Implementation

• **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Captures linear dependencies in time series data.

• **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** Models seasonal variations in price patterns.

• **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Deep learning-based model for capturing long-term dependencies.

# 4. Model Evaluation

Used metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** to assess accuracy.

# Tools & Technologies

**Python:** For model implementation and data analysis.

**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, tensorflow, Scikit-learn.

**Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for exploratory analysis and modeling.

# Future Scope

Incorporate external factors like global demand and trade policies.

Enhance model performance using hybrid models combining statistical and deep learning techniques.

Implement real-time forecasting with automated data pipelines.
